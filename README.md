# BLOG_FINAL_T
This a final project done with Django, based on Python for a Python Curse of Coderhouse learning platform.
The web is like a social media about pets. Users can visualize blogs, and have to sign in to comment an post. 
There's an app to send menssages to other users too.
Was a very nice experience.
